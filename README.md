 This is a personalized podcast summarizer that generates a custom newsletter for you every week, showcasing the highlights from your favorite podcast episodes!

üîç What does it do?
The podcast summarizer dives into the latest podcast episodes, leveraging the power of OpenAI's technology. Here's how it works:
* Transcription Magic: First, it uses Whisper, OpenAI's Speech to Text model, to accurately transcribe podcast episodes.
* Insight Extraction: Next, OpenAI's Large Language Model kicks in to extract key insights, including guest information, main topics discussed, and episode highlights.
* User-Friendly Interface: Finally, with the help of ChatGPT I created a front-end that offers a seamless end-to-end experience.
